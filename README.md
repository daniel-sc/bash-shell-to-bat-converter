Converts bash scripts (`*.sh`) to windows batch files (`*.bat`). 
This is _not_ supposed to be a fully complete/correct tool, but rather a starting point when converting scripts. 
For simple scripts this might create correct results.

## Usage

```sh
npx bash-converter FILE_TO_CONVERT.sh
```
This creates `FILE_TO_CONVERT.bat`.
